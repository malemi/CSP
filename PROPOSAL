Abstract

We want to propose a new concept of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP)
parabolic trough machine. We have identified the following problems in
current designs: sun tracking is made by independent detection of the
sun trajectory; macroscopic errors in single mirror modules are only
detected a posteriori through 3d reconstruction of the mirrors shape;
the focal line of the parabolic troughs, where the receiver lies,
moves during the day. Our design improves AFFRONTA all three points. 

The reduction of these uncertainties allows a better tracking of the
sun and a higher concentration factor. We have simulated both
traditional and our design. According to software simulations, the
proposed design allows a concentration factor of XX without any change
in the mirrors manufacturing. That would lead to a XX% gain in
electricity production.

Introduction 

What is CSP. differences btw 3d and 2d.

Chapter 1

the sun has a shape, maximum theoretical CP. 
actual CP and its origin: tracking, micro errors, macro errors.

Chapter 2

how they try today to tackle these issues? 
-good tracking
-good mirror positioning (ACCENNO AL VENTO)
-good mirrors --not too expansive though!

only the first two points can be improved. the third point is the same
for any design.
